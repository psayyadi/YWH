Youtube watch history

Python Version 3.6.4

This code contains functions to read the downloaded personal watch history from google account.
The pie chart gives you an idea how many of each category of videos you have watched over the interval which the history file covers.

The first thing to do is to download your google data which can be done in a few simple steps. Google gives you an HTML file for the watch history. You have to save that file and insert it in the code in url constant.
The second thing is to obtain your developer key to be able to interact with the youtube api. This api gives you the information regarding any youtube video in a clean format.

I have experimented with other possiblities on my watch history file and search history file.

You can extract a lot of interesting insights from these information about yourself and your past however after all this is just a data analysis practice and should be interpreted very carefully.
If you're interested in other related codes let me know; I'll upload them.

As an example of what else you can do with the data is how many videos you have watched every year (or every month or day); the following is my personal record and the result of days and nights of lying on the couch, watching youtube:
